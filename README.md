# MobilePhonePricePrediction

This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict the **price range** (Low, Mid, High) of a smartphone based on its hardware specifications such as RAM, storage, battery, CPU, and camera specs.

## ðŸ§  Objective

Develop a classification model to determine the price category of smartphones using Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost. Also includes explainability using SHAP.
