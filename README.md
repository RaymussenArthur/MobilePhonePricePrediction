## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key insights:
- Distribution analysis of features such as **RAM**, **Battery**, **CPU Core**, and **Rear Camera**.
- Correlation heatmap to visualize relationships between numerical features.
- Features like **Weight** and **Thickness** were dropped due to low impact on pricing based on EDA results.

## Model Development & Evaluation

Machine learning models tested:
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor (default and tuned)**

### ðŸ“ˆ Performance Summary

| Model               | RÂ² Score | RMSE    |
|:--------------------|:----------|:-----------|
| Random Forest        | 0.3825   | 476.80 |
| Gradient Boosting    | 0.4434   | 452.68 |
| XGBoost (Default)    | 0.6708   | 348.11 |
| **XGBoost (Tuned)**  | **0.7345** | **312.67** |

The **tuned XGBoost model** achieved the best performance.

## Model Usage

The final trained model is saved as a `.pkl` file and can be loaded using:

```python
import joblib
model = joblib.load('Results/trained_model.pkl')
prediction = model.predict(new_data)
```

## Conclusion
- The tuned XGBoost model delivered the best performance.
- The most influential features were: RAM, Battery, CPU Core, and Rear Camera.
- The model is ready to be used for predicting mid-tier smartphone prices based on technical specifications.
